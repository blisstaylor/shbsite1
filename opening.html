                    <p>The English company Dorman, Long and co successfully tendered to construct an arch bridge with
                        abutment towers faced with granite masonry for a cost of 4,217,722 pounds. Construction began in
                        1923 and on Saturday 19 March 1932 the Sydney Harbour Bridge was officially opened. The state
                        government declared the 19th a public holiday.</p>

                    <p>This image from a glass plate negative was taken during the opening day celebrations for the
                        Sydney Harbour Bridge on 19 March 1932. Flags are flying on the Bridge and small craft are
                        decorated with bunting. A Japanese passenger liner of the 'Kamo Maru' type is passing under the
                        Bridge and is not travelling as fast as it seems as the bow and stern wash has been painted onto
                        the original negative. In the foreground are a steam coaster and several small ferries, well
                        loaded with people looking towards the Bridge and a large crowd has assembled on the opposite
                        shore for the celebrations.</p>

                        his participation in the opening pageant. It is a significant reminder of the importance the
                        Sydney Harbour Bridge had in people's lives, not just on the opening day but during the many
                        years of its construction. The 'curve' dominated the skyline for many years and was a focus
                        of the souvenirs produced when it finally did open.</p>

            <div class="column-2">
                <div>
                    <p>A voluntary group the Sydney Harbour Bridge Celebrations Committee organised a week of 'pageantry
                        and display that would advertise to the world the faith and pride we have in our State and
                        Capital'. In October 1931 the Committee declared that the opening 'will form a landmark in
                        Australia's national history and , together with the subsequent festivities, will leave a deep
                        impression on the minds of the children ... more particularly as they will play such an
                        important part in the Pageantry and Church Thanksgiving Services.'</p>

                    <p>The program included sporting competitions, art exhibitions, balls and surf carnivals. Some
                        52,000 school children walked over the bridge three days before the opening. and over a million
                        people crossed the bridge in the first 24 hours after opening. The official opening attracted
                        thousands of spectators. An estimated 750,000 lined the city streets along the path of the
                        pageant and gathered on Observatory Hill.</p>

                    <p>Governor Sir Philip Game opened the official proceedings at 10 am with a congratulatory message
                        from King George V. The Premier, the Hon JT Lang, made a speech but before he could cut the
                        ribbon, Captain de Groot of the New Guard rode up and slashed it exclaiming 'in the name of the
                        decent and loyal citizens of New South Wales I declare this bridge open!' The ribbon was retied
                        and Lang opened the Bridge. The official party then motored to the northern side of the bridge
                        where the Mayor of North Sydney cut another ribbon. A two kilometre long Historic Pageant with
                        27 floats, military bands, war veterans and boy scouts proceeded across the Bridge. The pageant
                        was led by the Young Australia League Band followed by 656 specially selected children from
                        regional NSW schools, 100 bridge workers and a 'party of 25 picked Aborigines'. Once this was
                        complete the public were allowed to stream across. On 21 March 1932 the 'Daily Telegraph'
                        reported that 'over 1,000,000 people in trains, trams, vehicles and on foot crossed the newly
                        opened Harbour Bridge during the first 24 hours'. In the evening a Venetian Carnival of
                        illuminated boats concluded with a 20 minute firework display.</p>
