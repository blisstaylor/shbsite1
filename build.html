                        Harbour Bridge under construction with the two arches nearing connection and the stone pylons
                        incomplete. The photograph was take from Lavender Bay on the North Shore and in foreground are
                        the dual railway lines that lead to the North Shore terminus and replacement Milsons Point
                        wharf. The ferry 'Kuttabul' is approaching this wharf. The wharf pontoon still exists (2016) and
                        was used for many years at the Luna Park fun fair park. At various times it was used for dodgem
                        racing and as a dance hall. The electric trains seen in the image were known as 'red rattlers'.
                        The railway tracks are still used as 'lay-bys' for off-peak train sets.</p>
